# About this site

This tutorial arises from the idea of documenting the installation of my current arch install 
with the purpose of deeply understanding everything I ~~plagiarized~~ did in order to obtain such 
a solid system. As there are almost no up-to-date instructions for this specific setup, I decided 
to share it on the internet in extreme detail so that anyone can replicate it and understand it as well.

By using btrfs in order to make use of snapshots, luks for encryption and systemd-boot 
as bootloader, this arch install is truly unbreakable and easily recoverable.
